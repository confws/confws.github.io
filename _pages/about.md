# ConfWS aims
The Configuration Workshop (ConfWS) is a two-day event that started at the AAAI’96 Fall Symposium and from 1999 onwards has been continued at IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, CP, and SPLC conferences, as well as stand-alone. 
The workshop promotes high-quality research in all technical areas related to configuration and to bring together researchers working in the various fields of applicable technologies and industry representatives. The main goal is to engage participants from academia and industry in a working group to foster synergies and act as incubator of solutions, scenarios possibilities, and future projects on Artificial Intelligence techniques in the configuration domain.

The 27th edition in 2025 is co-located within the [28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)](https://ecai2025.org)
{: .text-justify}

ConfWS'25 welcomes contributions on configuration related topics, configuration problems and models, techniques for obtaining and/or maintaining configuration models, reasoning methods, intelligent user interfaces and business process integration applications and tools, new relevant contributions for product configuration.

## Reconfiguring Systems and Practices for Sustainability

In its 27th edition, the Workshop on Configuration will dedicate a research track to exploring reconfiguration as a strategic lever for sustainability transitions in production and consumption. This focus aligns with the growing interest in leveraging system- and practice-level transformations to meet ambitious sustainability goals and effectively implement circular economy principles.
{: .text-justify}

The aim of the special focus is to addresses a discussion on the urgent need for innovative approaches to drive sustainable development for reconfiguration techniques to address the challenges and promote practical solutions for social good. In particular, by framing reconfiguration as a dynamic and adaptive process, this focus aims to provide actionable insights and solutions for transitioning to a more sustainable future.
