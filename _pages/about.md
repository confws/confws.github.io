# ConfWS aims
The Configuration Workshop (ConfWS) is a two-day event that started at the AAAI’96 Fall Symposium and from 1999 onwards has been continued at IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, CP, and SPLC conferences, as well as stand-alone. 
The workshop promotes high-quality research in all technical areas related to configuration and to bring together researchers working in the various fields of applicable technologies and industry representatives. The main goal is to engage participants from academia and industry in a working group to foster synergies and act as incubator of solutions, scenarios possibilities, and future projects on Artificial Intelligence techniques in the configuration domain.
