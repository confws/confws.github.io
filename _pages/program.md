## Social Dinner

The social dinner of ConfWS'23 will be take placed at **[El Balneario - Baños del Carmen](https://goo.gl/maps/XPKbkEXx9ehhYPA78)**, 
a stylish restaurant serving seafood, wine and classic local fare in a seaside venue.

To arrive to the restaurant, the best option is **by bus - Line 11 -** which takes you directly from the conference venue or from the downtown. From the conference venue (E.T.S. Ingeniería Informática) take the bus at the initial stop *Louis Pasteur* with direction *El Palo (P. Virginia)*. Coming from Málaga downtown you can take it at the *Alameda Avenue* direction *El Palo (P. Virginia)*.
Leave the bus at the *Bolivia - Baños del Carmen* stop which is in front of the restaurant.

To come back to Málaga downtown, the available buses depend on the finish hour of the dinner. However, the line *N1* is available during all night. Another option is to take a walk throught the promenade (50 min.).
