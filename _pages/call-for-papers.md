## Overview

**Configuration** is a special type of design approach where the product being configured is composed from instances of a set of predefined component types that can be combined in ways defined by a set of constraints. This task requires powerful knowledge representation formalisms and acquisition methods to capture the variety and complexity of configurable products. Furthermore, efficient reasoning methods are required to support intelligent interactive behavior, solution search, satisfaction of user preferences, personalization, optimization, reconfiguration, and diagnosis.

#### Green Configuration
The focus on Green Configuration refers to the EU Green Deal as stated in the [EU Agenda 2050](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/twin-green-digital-transition-how-sustainable-digital-technologies-could-enable-carbon-neutral-eu-2022-06-29_en) to drive the EU community to a more sustainable future. EU Agenda 2050 fixes a pathway of goals to be urgently achieved by the whole production system at environmental, economic and social levels. Beside the EU Agenda 2050, given the condition of the global crisis it is urgent to address the green and digital transition also to re-configure traditional processes to face current and potential scarcity of resources and constant recession. Researcher from academia and industry are called to act jointly to provide solutions to operate more efficiently while facing time of crises (e.g., global health emergencies, consequences of conflicts and war in transport and resource scarcity, climate change) and to detect opportunities for a more sustainable future.
{: .text-justify}

Focus on Green Configuration addresses the following topics:

- **Recycling and waste management.**
Configuration process and waste prevention. Designing production processes for green configuration. Recycling strategies enabled by product configuration. Waste prevention with configuration processes. Refurbishing and remanufacturing configuration strategies.

- **Configuration process to engage users in green deal.**
UX to support sustainability. User engagement in green behaviors. Tomorrow's workforce in configuration management, training and education.


- **Configuration in time of crisis.**
Designing  solutions for critical environment. Mobility and sustainability. Smart Health approaches to configure new health care assistance.

- **Out of the box.**
Going beyond traditional configuration approaches opening up new horizons.

_Pushing the boundaries of reconfiguration strategies for sustainability_

The urgent global challenges of environmental crises and resource scarcity necessitate a fundamental shift toward more sustainable production and consumption models. In particular, transitioning from a linear to a circular production model is increasingly recognized as essential for corporate survival and competitiveness in European markets (link to the European agenda). Accordingly, the special focus will encompass two key analytical perspectives:
{: .text-justify}

(a) *AI-Driven Reconfiguration of Products, Processes, and Systems:* This perspective explores how these technologies can address sustainability challenges and drive practical solutions that generate positive environmental, economic and societal impact. Investigating how AI techniques facilitate reconfiguration to meet sustainability goals, with a particular emphasis on modular design approaches, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, and AI-based diagnostic tools.
{: .text-justify}

(b) *Reconfiguring Production and Consumption Practices:* This perspective includes examining how new drivers—such as emerging technologies, evolving meanings, and skill transformations—are introduced and integrated into existing practices. Analyzing to what extent the reconfiguration of production and consumption practices interrelates and and how targeted interventions can initiate self-reinforcing cycles of sustainable change.
{: .text-justify}

The special focus welcomes studies from various sectors (e.g., mobility, energy, furniture, and fashion) where system and practice reconfiguration are either actively taking place or holds significant potential to accelerate the transition toward sustainability. We welcome theoretical frameworks, methodological advancements, and reviews that contribute to a deeper understanding of reconfiguration strategies for sustainability and circularity.
{: .text-justify}

Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to share theoretical insights, practical applications, and technological innovations that advance the design and implementation of reconfiguration strategies, fostering more sustainable and adaptive systems. As well as research that address the following themes (but not limited to):
{: .text-justify}

- **Reconfiguration Strategies and Tools**: approaches for integrating sustainability into production systems, including modular design, reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), and adaptive business models.
{: .text-justify}

- **Flexible and AI-Driven Technologies**: the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and flexible production systems in reconfiguring processes, products, and supply chains for improved efficiency and sustainability.
{: .text-justify}

- **Sustainability Constraints in Configuration Problems**: methods for embedding eco-efficiency, resource optimization, and recyclability into decision-making frameworks.
{: .text-justify}

- **Advanced AI Techniques for Reconfiguration**: applications of genetic algorithms, SAT-solving, and Answer Set Programming (ASP) to support dynamic and sustainable system reconfiguration; AI-driven anytime diagnosis and adaptive systems responding to evolving sustainability regulations and disruptions in supply chains.
{: .text-justify}

- **Evaluation Metrics and Impact Assessment**: frameworks for measuring the effectiveness of reconfiguration initiatives at various scales.
{: .text-justify}

- **Circular Economy and Reconfiguration**: case studies on product life extension, repairability, reusability, and remanufacturing through reconfiguration strategies.
{: .text-justify}


## Paper Submission
- **Full papers** are limited to 10 pages (including references). 
- **Position statements** and **problem instances** can be submitted as **short papers** limited to 4 pages (including references). 
- **Published articles:** It is possible to submit already published or submitted articles. In that case, submit both a **one-page abstract** (600 words) and the article, and take note that the article will not be included in the proceedings. A limited number (max 4) of already published articles will be accepted.

Full and short papers submitted to ConfWS 2025 must be original. The submission, or a highly similar version of it, cannot have been published or accepted in a journal or another conference proceedings. Further, submissions must not be concurrently under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. In this case, consider to submit your work as a **published article** (one-page abstract).

Each submission will be subject to peer review by at least two members of the program committee. Refereeing criteria are relevance to workshop topics, significance and novelty of the research, technical content, discussion of relationship to previous work, and clarity of presentation. A contribution submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper, if the program committee considers it to be inadequate for a long full paper but to present an important issue. 
{: .text-justify}

**Website submission:** Papers should be submitted to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=confws2025).

**Formatting guidelines:** Both full and short papers must be formatted in PDF according to the new [CEUR-ART style](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/) using the **two-columns template**.
