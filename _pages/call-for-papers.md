## Overview

**Configuration** is a special type of design approach where the product being configured is composed from instances of a set of predefined component types that can be combined in ways defined by a set of constraints. This task requires powerful knowledge representation formalisms and acquisition methods to capture the variety and complexity of configurable products. Furthermore, efficient reasoning methods are required to support intelligent interactive behavior, solution search, satisfaction of user preferences, personalization, optimization, reconfiguration, and diagnosis.

The Configuration Workshop (ConfWS) is a two-day event that started at the AAAI’96 Fall Symposium and from 1999 onwards has been continued at IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, CP, and SPLC conferences, as well as stand-alone. It is structured as a working group that brings together researchers from academia and experts from industry as well as company managers and industry representatives to foster a constructive debate on Artificial Intelligence techniques in the configuration, customization and co-design strategies to find optimal solutions to solve real life problems and challenges.

The 26th edition in 2024 is co-located within the [International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2024)](https://cp2024.a4cp.org/)

## Topics of interest
ConfWS 2024 is dedicated to **Green Configuration** which currently is a hot topic in industry. The topic refers to the EU Green Deal as stated in the [EU Agenda 2030](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/twin-green-digital-transition-how-sustainable-digital-technologies-could-enable-carbon-neutral-eu-2022-06-29_en) to drive the EU community to a more sustainable future. EU Agenda 2030 fixes a pathway of goals to be urgently achieved by the whole production system at environmental, economic and social levels. Given the condition of the global crisis it is urgent to address the green and digital transition also to re-configure traditional processes to face current and potential scarcity of resources and constant recession.

Researchers from both academia and industry are called to cooperate synergically to re-configured economic, environmental and social scenarios. They need to act jointly to provide solutions to to operate more efficiently while facing time of crises (e.g., global health emergencies, consequences of conflicts and war in transport and resource scarcity, climate change) and to detect opportunities for a more sustainable future.

## Paper Submission
- **Full papers** are limited to 10 pages (including references). 
- **Position statements** and **problem instances** can be submitted as **short papers** limited to 4 pages (including references). 
- **Published articles:** It is possible to submit already published or submitted articles. In that case, submit both a **one-page abstract** (600 words) and the article, and take note that the article will not be included in the proceedings. A limited number (max 4) of already published articles will be accepted.

Full and short papers submitted to ConfWS 2024 must be original. The submission, or a highly similar version of it, cannot have been published or accepted in a journal or another conference proceedings. Further, submissions must not be concurrently under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. In this case, consider to submit your work as a **published article** (one-page abstract).

Each submission will be subject to peer review by at least two members of the program committee. Refereeing criteria are relevance to workshop topics, significance and novelty of the research, technical content, discussion of relationship to previous work, and clarity of presentation. A contribution submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper, if the program committee considers it to be inadequate for a long full paper but to present an important issue. 
{: .text-justify}

**Website submission:** Papers should be submitted to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=confws2024).

**Formatting guidelines:** Both full and short papers must be formatted in PDF according to the new [CEUR-ART style](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/) using the two-columns template.
- [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk)
- [Latex template](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip)
- [DOCX template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-2col.docx)
- [ODT template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-2col.odt)

Latex users should modify the following code placed at the start of the Latex document as follows:

```
\copyrightyear{2024}
\conference{ConfWS'24: 26th International Workshop on Configuration, Sep 2--3, 2024, Girona, Spain}
```

Word users should modify the same information at the bottom of the first page.

**Publication:**
The proceedings will be published in the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings library](https://ceur-ws.org/). 

At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper in ConfWS'24 in order for the submission to be published.
