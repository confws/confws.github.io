## Overview

Product configuration is the task of composing product models of complex systems from parameterizable components in the mass-customization business model.
Configuration is a special type of design approach where the product being configured is composed from instances of a set of predefined component types that can be combined in ways defined by a set of constraints. This task requires powerful knowledge representation formalisms and acquisition methods to capture the variety and complexity of configurable products. Furthermore, efficient reasoning methods are required to support intelligent interactive behavior, solution search, satisfaction of user preferences, personalization, optimization, reconfiguration, and diagnosis.

Configuration Workshop (ConfWS) is a two-day event that started at the AAAIâ€™96 Fall Symposium and continued at IJCAI, AAAI, and ECAI conferences, since 1999. The ConfWS at its 26th edition is structured as a working group that brings together researchers from academia and industry as well as company managers and industry representatives to foster a constructive debate on Artificial Intelligence techniques in the configuration, customization and co-design strategies to find optimal solutions to solve real life problems and challenges.

ConfWS 2024 is co-located within the [International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2024)](https://cp2024.a4cp.org/)

## Topics
ConfWS 2024 is dedicated to Twin Green and Digital Configuration being this the main topic. However, topics include but are not limited to following ones allowing submissions not related to "green configuration":

- **Green configuration.**
The topic refers to green and digital deals stated in the EU Agenda 2030 to drive the EU community to a more sustainable future. EU Agenda 2030 fixes a pathway of goals to be urgently achieved by the whole production system at environmental, economic and social levels. Given the condition of the global crisis it is urgent to address the green and digital transition also as need to re-configure traditional processes to face current and potential scarcity of resources and constant recession. 
Researchers from both academia and industry are called to cooperate synergically to re-configured economic, environmental and social scenarios. It urges to act jointly to provide solutions to to operate more efficiently also while facing time of crises (e.g., health global emergencies, war consequences of conflicts and war in transport and resource scarcity, climate change and it consequences). It urges to act jointly academia and industry to detect how convert crisis into opportunities for a more sustainable future.

## Paper Submission
- **Full papers** are limited to 10 pages (including references). 
- **Position statements** and **problem instances** can be submitted as **short papers** limited to 4 pages (including references). 
- **Published articles:** It is possible to submit already published or submitted articles. In that case, submit both a **one-page abstract** (600 words) and the article, and take note that the article will not be included in the proceedings. A limited number (max 4) of already published articles will be accepted.

Full and short papers submitted to ConfWS 2024 must be original. The submission, or a highly similar version of it, cannot have been published or accepted in a journal or another conference proceedings. Further, submissions must not be concurrently under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. In this case, consider to submit your work as a **published article** (one-page abstract).

Each submission will be subject to peer review by at least two members of the program committee. Refereeing criteria are relevance to workshop topics, significance and novelty of the research, technical content, discussion of relationship to previous work, and clarity of presentation. A contribution submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper, if the program committee considers it to be inadequate for a long full paper but to present an important issue.

**Website submission:** Papers should be submitted to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=confws2024).

**Formatting guidelines:** Both full and short papers must be formatted in PDF according to the new [CEUR-ART style](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/) using the two-columns template.
- [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk)
- [Latex template](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip)
- [DOCX template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-2col.docx)
- [ODT template](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-2col.odt)

Latex users should modify the following code placed at the start of the Latex document as follows:

```
\copyrightyear{2024}
\conference{ConfWS'24: 26th International Workshop on Configuration, Sep 2--3, 2024, Girona, Spain}
```

Word users should modify the same information at the bottom of the first page.

**Publication:**
The proceedings will be published in the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings library](https://ceur-ws.org/). 

At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper in ConfWS'24 in order for the submission to be published.
