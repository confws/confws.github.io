 The ConfWS 2023 introduced the figure of *Award Chair* in the organization committee, a role played by Michel Aldanondo (Université de Toulouse, France), who was in charge of managing the selection of the best paper awards in a two-phase audience vote at the end of the workshop. This forum presents awards to the best papers since ConfWS 2015.

This year, in ConfWS 2025, the Best Paper Award winner were:

- **Best Paper Award**: _Generative Design as a Configuration Problem_ by Jonathan Raines, David Barton and Ben Hicks.
- **Best Student Paper Award**: *From 4GL Spreadsheet Computations to Constraint Model Definitions – A Development Process* by Boi Schaefer and Lothar Hotz.
